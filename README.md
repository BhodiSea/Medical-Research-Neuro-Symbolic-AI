- Comprehensive medical safety rules and ethical constraints
- 31 AI systems integrated as submodules with wrapper interfaces
- Development infrastructure (testing, formatting, packaging)
- Complete documentation and development guidance

**What's Framework-Ready ⚠️**
- All AI reasoning components use well-designed mock implementations
- Database repositories are abstract base classes requiring CRUD implementation
- Authentication system has JWT framework but needs token management
- Neural networks have PyTorch architectures but are untrained
- Hybrid reasoning bridge has complete architecture but placeholder logic

**What's Vision/Planned 🔴**
- 10th Man multi-agent deliberation system

base_url = "http://localhost:8000"

# Health check
response = requests.get(f"{base_url}/health")
print(f"Server status: {response.json()}")

# Submit medical research query
query_data = {
    "query": "What are the latest biomarkers for early Parkinson's detection?",
    "query_type": "research",
    "urgency": "normal"
}

response = requests.post(f"{base_url}/api/v1/medical/query", json=query_data)
result = response.json()

print(f"AI Response: {result['response']['answer']}")
print(f"Confidence: {result['confidence_score']}")

- **Fairness Assessment**: Equitable treatment validation across patient populations  
- **Explainability**: All AI decisions include interpretable reasoning paths
- **Human Oversight**: Required human review for medical decisions
- **Safety Monitoring**: Real-time safety signal detection and response protocols

### Dissent Protocol

**Mandatory Dissent System**:
- **Purpose**: Reduce consensus bias through systematic counterarguments
- **Implementation**: One AI agent required to challenge consensus
- **Scope**: Research analysis only, not medical advice
- **Evaluation**: Human expert review of all generated perspectives
- **Bias Resistance**: Systematic challenge of research hypotheses

**Example Agent Deliberation Trace**:
```
Query: "Should we recommend early levodopa treatment for Parkinson's patients?"

Agent 1 (Neurologist): "Analysis supports levodopa as standard treatment with quality of life benefits"
Agent 2 (Pharmacologist): "Analysis confirms benefit-risk ratio supports early intervention"
Agent 3 (Ethics): "Analysis indicates patient autonomy supports symptom management approach"

Agent 10 (Dissent): "COUNTERANALYSIS: Early levodopa may accelerate motor complications. 
Alternative analysis suggests dopamine agonists first, especially in younger patients. 
Long-term dyskinesia risk requires additional consideration."

Result: Analysis identifies need for age-stratified treatment protocols
```

## FAQ & Troubleshooting

### Mathematical Foundation & Simulation Engine

**Q: Is the Julia quantum modeling actually implemented?**
A: Yes! The core quantum models are implemented in `math_foundation/qft_qm.jl` with Python wrappers. See [`docs/mathematical_foundation.md`](docs/mathematical_foundation.md) for complete details.

**Q: What are "flash cycles" and how do they work?**
A: Flash cycles simulate accelerated experiential learning through 1000x time compression, quasi-partitioned memory, and entropy caps. See the Technical Clarifications section above.

**Q: How does the simulation engine differ from traditional LLM training?**
A: Instead of supervised fine-tuning, the system uses experiential simulation with moral development, quantum uncertainty quantification, and biological time compression.

### Common Issues

**Q: Julia integration not working?**
A: Install Julia 1.9+ and PyJulia: `pip install julia`. See installation instructions above.

**Q: AutoDock not available?**
A: Install AutoDock Vina from http://vina.scripps.edu/ and ensure `vina` executable is in PATH.

**Q: Mathematical foundation tests failing?**
A: Run `python examples/mathematical_foundation_integration_test.py` to diagnose issues.

**Q: API endpoints returning errors?**
A: Check that all dependencies are installed and the database is properly initialized.
