### Medical Safety Guidelines

- **Research Purposes Only**: This system is for research purposes only. Never remove medical disclaimers or safety checks.
- **Privacy First**: All personal data handling must comply with differential privacy settings in ethical_constraints.yaml.
- **Hybrid Reasoning**: The system is designed to combine symbolic and neural approaches for comprehensive medical research analysis - avoid bypassing either component.
- **Ethical Compliance**: All features must align with the comprehensive ethical framework defined in configuration.

### Development Best Practices

- **Mock-First Development**: Current architecture uses well-designed mock implementations that should be replaced with functional AI reasoning
- **Configuration-Driven**: All AI behavior should be configurable through YAML files
- **Safety-First**: Medical applications require extensive safety checks and ethical oversight
- **Modular Design**: Components should be loosely coupled and independently testable
- **Documentation**: Maintain clear distinction between implemented features and conceptual/planned features

### Integration Patterns

**Open Source Components**: Integrated as subdirectories under respective layers
- Excluded from linting/formatting (see pyproject.toml exclude patterns)
- Custom wrapper files provide integration points
- Original licenses maintained (see CREDITS.md)

**Multi-Language Integration**:
- Python (main application and AI coordination)
- Rust (safety-critical components and performance)
- Julia (mathematical computations and modeling)
- Ensure compatibility when making changes across languages

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Individual component functionality
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-component interactions and data flow
- **Mock Validation**: Comprehensive testing of current mock implementations
- **Safety Testing**: Ethics and compliance validation in all test suites
- **Performance Testing**: Benchmarking for scalability planning

### Contribution Guidelines

**For Current Implementation:**
- Focus on replacing mock implementations with functional AI
- Maintain existing architecture and interfaces
- Ensure all changes pass ethical compliance validation
- Write comprehensive tests for new functionality

**For Advanced Features:**
- Start with detailed design documents
- Implement safety mechanisms first
- Ensure ethical oversight for simulation capabilities
- Maintain transparency in decision-making processes

## Production Considerations

### Development Approach
This codebase represents a sophisticated architectural foundation with excellent engineering practices. The README describes an ambitious vision for medical research acceleration, while the actual implementation provides a solid base for building toward those goals. Contributors should focus on:

1. **Immediate Priority**: Replace mock implementations with functional AI reasoning
2. **Medium Term**: Integrate existing submodules and build database persistence
3. **Long Term**: Implement advanced features like simulation engines and multi-agent deliberation

The gap between vision and implementation is significant, but the foundation is exceptionally well-designed for achieving these ambitious goals through systematic development.
